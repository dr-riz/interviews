# Interviews

I am going to use this repo as a collection of exercises and questions that were asked of me during different interviews. For exercises, I include my attempts. I made them transparent/public for readers to get a sense of my coding skills which continually evolve over time.

As a problem solver, approach is:
- mvp asap (with a concrete acceptance criteria and 
- iterate over mvp for optimization and improvements
- big fan of wiki/docs to generate interest and knowledge transfer

# Academic
### [PhD](mian_14_PhD_certificate.pdf)
Aug 09 - Nov 13	Queen's University, Canada
(4y)	Database Systems Lab	(http://queensdsl.weebly.com/). 
Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computer Science. 
**Advisor: Prof. Patrick Martin, Prof. Farhana Zulkernine**.
*Thesis: [Cost-Effective Resource Configurations for Executing Data-intensive Workloads in Public. Clouds](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/handle/1974/8497?show=full)*.

**Condensed abstract**
The promise of "infinite" resources given by the cloud computing paradigm has led to recent interest in exploiting clouds for large-scale data-intensive computing. Given this supposedly infinite resource set, we need a management function that regulates application workloads on these resources. This doctoral research focuses on two aspects of workload management, namely data processing and provisioning. I design an autonomic and generic framework for workload execution and resource provisioning. I develop search algorithms, and associated performance and cost models to minimize the cost of executing data-intensive workloads in a cloud. The work is evaluated using diverse workloads in the Amazon public cloud.

### MPhil
Jul 04 - Jul 05	The University of Manchester, UK.
(1y)	Software Systems	(www.manchester.ac.uk/research/).
Masters of Philosophy (MPhil) in Computer Science bypassing MSc.
**Advisor: Prof. John Gurd**.
*Thesis: [Managing distributed information for performance control of Grid-based applications](mian_05_grid-based_applications_mphil_thesis.pdf)*. 

**Condensed abstract**
Performance control systems improve the execution performance of an application, at runtime, based on data; which may be generated by different components of a geographically distributed application. In this study, effective data management has been studied by developing a performance information repository, Perfrep. This investigation abstracts and quantifies effects of localizing the information against centrally managing information. Perfrep has been extended to use local performance control at the distributed sites. This work is particularly suitable for those systems that generate plentiful performance information at distributed sites, and require that performance information both locally and on a remote site.
